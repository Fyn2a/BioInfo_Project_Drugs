## Druglikeness
Druglikeness refers to the similarity of the properties between compounds and existing drugs.

Druglike compounds are more likely to be transformed into drugs. Descriptors of druglikeness include the classic Rule of Five (Ro5) as originally proposed by Lipinski which describes molecular properties important for a drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics in the human body. This include intrinsic properties of a compound that will lead to favourable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) characteristics.

### The Rule of 5 claims to predict that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are:

* more than 5 H-bond donors (-OH).
* 10 H-bond acceptors (-O)
- as more HBD & HBA means very high hyrophilicity.
* molecular weight (MWT) greater than 500 (for penetrating the brain-blood bariar).
* calculated Log P (CLogP) greater than 5 (Octanol-water partitianing, it means that it can not be too hydrophilic )

## Note: This hypothesis has been called into question in the case of antibiotics. Antibiotics are unique molecules and must be able to penetrate bacterial cells and not just human cells. They have always been an exception to the Lipinski rules.

### As a summary:
### MW < 500 Daltons
### LogP < 5
### HBD < 5
### HBA < 10
